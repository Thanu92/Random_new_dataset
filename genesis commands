#One time installation
#Alternatively, in order to stay up to date, you can clone the repository. For this, you need to have Git installed. Then, call

git clone https://github.com/lczech/genesis.git
#in some directory. This will create a sub-directory genesis, containing all files. In case new commits are pushed to the GitHub repository, you can call

git pull

#Build
#In the stand-alone variant, to build all of Genesis, call

make

#If you just pulled new commits from the repository, or added new files to be compiled (either an app, some lib function, or tests), you can call

make update

#In the following folder we can find labelled_tree program
#need to transfer jplace files(it's a must) and also RAxML_best/results (optional) to this folder
/home/thanuja/genesis/bin/apps
#./labelled_tree <jplace_file> [<newick_tree_file>] <output_newick_tree_file>
./labelled_tree R20_1.jplace R20_1.nwk

If the optional <newick_tree_file> is given, this tree is used instead of the tree contained in the jplace file. It has to be topologically identical to the jplace tree, but can contain additional values like bootstrap support values. Currently, we only support such values that are stored as inner node names. This is for example given if a bootstrap tree of RAxML is used. When working with trees containing such values at inner nodes, also be aware of issues that might arise with other programs.
